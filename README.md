# Standalone jdk.compiler.home

## What

This repository builds artifacts for the [standalone
jdk.compiler](https://github.com/kohlschutter/jdk.compiler.standalone),
specifically contents of arbitrary java.home directories, specifically the
contents of lib/modules and lib/ct.sym, which are required by the standalone
compiler.

## Why

This allows a very simple packaging of all compiler resources as simple Maven
artifacts.

## How

By default, the require build utilities are built, and a rather empty main jar
is created:

    mvn clean install

Run the following commands to build a jar containing all required contents from
a given java.home directory:

    mvn clean install -Dclassifier=jdk11-javac -Djavahome.dir=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.20.1+1/Contents/Home

(adjust the path accordingly, and change the value for "classifier" as well)

## Caveats

When working in Eclipse, close the project "standalone-home", otherwise
workspace resolution may not find the right jar.
